📊 Overview
Dashboard created in Looker Studio.

This project presents an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of orange production at a Brazilian farm, using data collected between 2020 and 2024. The dashboard was created in Looker Studio and provides visual insights into key indicators such as total yield, productivity per hectare, seasonal variations, rainfall influence, and operational efficiency.

The goal is to help decision-makers monitor production trends, identify bottlenecks, and support sustainable agricultural practices by integrating climate and soil data into the analysis.

The data was processed using Python and Excel, and visualized in an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter by year, plot, and weather conditions.
